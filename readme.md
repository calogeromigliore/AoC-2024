# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my repository for Advent of Code 2024! ðŸŽ„âœ¨

Advent of Code is an annual event that consists of 25 programming puzzles, one for each day in December. The goal is to solve them and improve your programming skills by tackling problems related to logic, data structures, algorithms, and much more.

In this repository, you'll find the solutions to the problems presented during 2024, with the code written in PHP.
